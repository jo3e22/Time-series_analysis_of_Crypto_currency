This is an undergraduate project for computer techniques in physics, semmester 2 2025

## intro

## Plan/ layout
* Import data
* view raw
* determine necassary smoothing
* what timeframe do i want to be analising?  smoothing a full year is unfeassable with current method, but maybe want to be looking at short timeframes?
